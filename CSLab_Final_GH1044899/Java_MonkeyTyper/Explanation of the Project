"Game Structure and how the game works"

1)A paragraph of 50 words appears on the screen
2)The user starts typing
  -correct letters turns black
  -mistyped letters turn red
  -remaining text stays gray
3)The player scores 1 point after completing one word correctly. And player should press "space" to move on to the next word.
4)The countdown starts from 60 seconds
5)When the time runs out a pop up window will show up and tell you your score

-Main Class - Pokemon_Monkey_Typer
1)This class contains all the game logic, Event handling and the gui setup
2)It extends JFrame and it means that the game runs inside a swing window
3)And this class implements KeyListener and ActionListener
 -KeyListener: for keyboard inputs
 -ActionListener: for time countdown

-Swing components I used
1)JFrame: creates the game window
2)JLabel: displays all the text (paragraph, timer)
3)Timer: runs the countdown
4)JOptionPane: final score pop-up
5)Font: style, text font 

-Events
1)KeyListener
  -keyTyped: detects normal keys and space 
  -keyPressed: detects backspace
  -keyReleased: it is required when you use the keylistener but i didn't use this in my code
2)ActionListener
  -actionPerformed: runs every second to decrease the timer

-Other utility classes used in the code
1)ArrayList: Stores all the words 
2)Random: Choosing random words from the array list
3)StringBuilder: Builds the paragraph in a html style text to make it look more stylish
